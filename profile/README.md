# Welcome to the Distributed Haskell organization

This GitHub organization is dedicated to the implementation of [Cloud Haskell](https://simon.peytonjones.org/haskell-cloud/).

Cloud Haskell is a domain-specific language for developing distributed systems using the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) popularized by Erlang. It combines the Erlang model of scheduling remote execution of computation and handling of failure, with Haskell's advantages such as type safety.

The implementation of the Cloud Haskell ideas is centered around the [`distributed-process`](https://github.com/haskell-distributed/distributed-process) repository.

You can find documentation and tutorials on [haskell-distributed.github.io](https://haskell-distributed.github.io).
